A number of open-source datasets and tools often used by network applications:
## Graph data repositories
- **Open Graph Benchmark (OGB)**: a collection of realistic, large-scale, and diverse benchmark datasets for machine learning on graphs [^1]
- **OThe Network Repository**: contains hundreds of real-world networks and benchmark datasets [^2]
- **OStanford Large Network Dataset Collection (SNAP)**: analysis of large social and information networks [^3]

## Graph learning
- **PyTorch Geometric**: a library built upon PyTorch to easily write and train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) [^4]
- **Deep Graph Library (DGL)**: a Python package for deep learning on graphs [^5],
- **Dive into Graphs (DIG)**: a turnkey library for graph deep learning research [^6]
- **PyTorch Geometric Temporal**: a temporal graph neural network extension library for PyTorch Geometric [^7]
- **Torch-points3d**: a framework for running common deep learning models for point cloud analysis tasks against classic benchmark [^8]
- **GraphChallenge.org** [^9]
- **XGI**: modeling and analyzing complex systems with group (higher-order) interactions[^10]
- **PyGSP**: Graph Signal Processing in Python [^11]
- **NetworkX**: a Python package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks [^12]

## Diffusion model
- **NDlib**: a Python software package that allows to describe, simulate, and study diffusion processes on complex networks [^13]
- **Cosasi**: a Python package for graph diffusion source localization[^14]
- **EpiModel**: Mathematical Modeling of Infectious Disease Dynamics [^15]
